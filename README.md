# Introduction
The aim of this project was to create a game of rock-paper-scissors. The program uses the playerâ€™s webcam image to determine their chosen move in real time.
The computerâ€™s move is then randomized after a period of time, and points are finally awarded.

Modules used in this project:
- [mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe),
- [openCV](https://opencv.org/)

The code was inspired by these tutorials: 
[logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV9Is2FRRkA) and [interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2EahPgl0ho)
